                        <h2>College Support</h2>
                        <p>Many young people with higher functioning autism spectrum go to college after high school. Since
                            they often do well academically in a K-12 setting, it is generally assumed that they’ll manage
                            well in college and beyond. But they continue to have Autism and they continue to need the structure
                            and supports they were provided while growing up.</p>

                        <p>Conventional wisdom holds that the biggest problems for higher functioning individuals are social
                            and communication issues. But they also struggle with life skills and disrupted executive function
                            —the mental processes involving organization, planning, time management and multitasking. This
                            makes college, their first venture into independent living, especially challenging. Their executive
                            functioning capabilities are swamped by the new responsibilities of managing an independent life
                            as a college student -- living in a dorm or apartment, scheduling homework and maintaining proper
                            nutrition.
                        </p>
                        <p>These new challenges occur at the same time they lose the educational support services they’ve had
                            through most of their life. Many students a;so have other, accompanying problems, including anxiety
                            and ADHD, that may makes self-management much harder.
