                    <h2>Self Awareness and Self Advocacy</h2>
                    <p>
                        It’s important that young people with autism understand their strengths and challenges to achieve their goals. It’s also
                        important that they are able to describe how autism affects their style of learning and interactions
                        with others. Self awareness about autism can help young people ask for appropriate clarifications
                        or supports, for example,
                        <i> “I’m sorry, but I have language issues. Would you please speak more slowly?”
                        </i> At the same time, this self awareness shouldn’t be used to excuse negligence or inappropriate
                        behavior because “I have autism.”
                    </p>
                    <p>Effective self-advocacy is often tied to decisions about when and how to disclose an autism diagnosis.
                        It may be necessary to disclose autism in order to explain why an accommodation is needed or helpful.
                    </p>
                    <p>Developing self-advocacy and disclosure skills requires direct instruction. Areas of instruction provided
                        by Spectrum Connections may include:
                    </p>

                    <h2>Job Preparedness</h2>
                    <p>Identifying realistic job goals is a challenge for young adults with autism. Many may be hired, especially
                        when labor markets are tight, but they often struggle with keeping jobs long term because the job
                        turns out to be a poor match for their skills.
                    </p>
                    <p>Spectrum Connections works with young adults to help them prepare for a realistic job search. Areas of

                    <h2>Interview Intensive</h2>
                    <p>Interviews play a key role in getting a job. They can also be a major hurdle for job seekers with autism
                        who aren’t skilled at reading social cues or thinking flexibly when responding to hypothetical questions.
                        Early research concludes that direct instruction in the social mechanics of job interviews can improve
                        the interview performance of job seekers with autism and, in turn, their likelihood of getting a
                        job.
                    </p>
                    <p>Spectrum Connections offers an Interview Intensive designed to help job seekers with autism learn and
                        use the key skills they need to make a positive impression on potential employers. </p>
                    <p>The Interview Intensive consists of 4 - 5 interview skill learning sessions which focus instruction on
                        customized learning goals, such as projecting confidence; engaging in reciprocal conversation; and
                        maintaining appropriate eye contact with an interviewer. Participants then participate in 2 to 4
                        mock interviews with business professionals. Pre- and post-training assessments are used to measure
                        participant interview skill development as a result of the program.

                    <h2>Post-Secondary Navigation</h2>
                    <p>The number of students with autism who attend post-secondary schools is rapidly increasing. During grade
                        school through high school, these students were supported by teams of educators and specialists who
                        were required by law to offer those services. After high school, the legal mandate suddenly ends
                        and there is no federal requirement to provide services for students who still need supports and
                        are entering the new, complicated and confusing world of post-secondary school.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        All post-secondary schools have disability service offices which can offer accommodations for academic needs, but typically
                        don’t provide services to address their social communication and executive function challenges. In
                        addition, many students with autism don’t register with these offices, often because of their anxiety
                        about their diagnosis.
                    </p>

                    <p> This list is a summary of responses from post-secondary students with autism about the services they
                        received in college compared to the services they most commonly needed.
